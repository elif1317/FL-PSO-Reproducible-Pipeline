# FL-PSO-Reproducible-Pipeline

Fully reproducible experimental pipeline for the Residual-Corrected Fractional–Langevin
Particle Swarm Optimization (FL-PSO), including benchmark evaluation, ablation settings,
and fixed function-evaluation budgets.

The entire experimental framework is implemented in a single Python script and
reproduces all numerical results reported in the accompanying manuscript under
fixed and transparent evaluation protocols.
